# Final Project

### Dylan Belcourt
#### My Project
when I first started this project all I knew is that in the end i wanted to make a music visualizer. I didn't know what I wanted it to do or how i was going to do it. As i went on with the project i found that i wanted to make the visualizer be different for each instrument instead of the song as a whole. I then created a number of loops with a number of different instruments and then started from there.
