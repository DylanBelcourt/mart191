# HW5

## What I did
  This weeks homework consisted of me just typing things and seeing what they did. When something didn't look right to me i would just change a value change the operation. Eventually after a lot of plug and play I landed on what I have now.

## Use The Videos
  The videos are very helpful and are what I use to get started.
